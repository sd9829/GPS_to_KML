# CSCI420_Project
Project for CSCI 420 Fall 2021 - GPS to KML project

Description:
·	Created .kml files from over fifty text files, to analyze it on Google Maps and mark frequent places, stops, turns and anomalies, and acquire data about the person using their routes. 
·	Filtered the data to remove anomalies and duplicate data, which was 50% of the entire data, using multiple Python libraries like NumPy, basemap, scikit - learn, and collections. 
·	Computed vector calculations to get rid of unwanted turns and to find correct and wrong turns.
